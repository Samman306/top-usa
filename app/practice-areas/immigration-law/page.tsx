        question: "How long does the immigration process take?",
        answer:
          "Immigration timelines vary significantly based on the type of application, current processing backlogs, and your specific circumstances. Family-based petitions can take 1-5+ years depending on the relationship and country of origin. Employment-based cases typically take 1-3 years. Naturalization usually takes 6-18 months. Our attorneys can provide more specific estimates based on your situation and current USCIS processing times.",

      {
        question: "What's the difference between a green card and citizenship?",
        answer:
          "A green card (permanent residency) allows you to live and work permanently in the United States but doesn't grant voting rights or a U.S. passport. You must maintain residency requirements and renew your card periodically. Citizenship, obtained through naturalization after typically 3-5 years as a permanent resident, provides full rights including voting, a U.S. passport, protection from deportation, and the ability to petition for more family members.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do if I receive a notice to appear in immigration court?",
        answer:
          "A Notice to Appear (NTA) initiates removal proceedings and should be taken very seriously. Contact an immigration attorney immediatelyâ€”do not miss your court date as this could result in an automatic deportation order. Our attorneys can help you understand the charges against you, explore potential relief options such as asylum, cancellation of removal, or adjustment of status, and represent you throughout the proceedings.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can criminal convictions affect my immigration status?",
        answer:
          "Yes, criminal convictions can significantly impact your immigration status, potentially leading to inadmissibility, deportation, or denial of naturalization. The severity depends on the type of crime, when it occurred, and your current status. Even minor offenses or those expunged from your record may have immigration consequences. If you have any criminal history, consult with an immigration attorney before filing any applications or traveling internationally.",
