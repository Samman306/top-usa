    {
      question: "What should I do immediately after a workplace injury?",
      answer:
        "First, seek medical attention for your injuries, even if they seem minor. Report the injury to your supervisor or employer as soon as possibleâ€”many states have strict deadlines for reporting workplace injuries. Document everything related to the accident and your injuries, including photos if possible. Follow your doctor's treatment plan carefully. Then contact our attorneys to understand your legal options beyond workers' compensation, as you may be entitled to additional compensation through third-party claims.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between workers' compensation and a personal injury claim?",
      answer:
        "Workers' compensation is a no-fault insurance system that provides benefits regardless of who caused the workplace accident. It typically covers medical expenses and partial wage replacement but doesn't compensate for pain and suffering. Personal injury claims, which may be available against third parties (not your employer), require proving negligence but can provide fuller compensation including pain and suffering, full lost wages, and other damages not covered by workers' comp.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sue my employer for a workplace injury?",
      answer:
        "In most states, workers' compensation is the 'exclusive remedy' against employers, meaning you generally cannot sue your employer for a workplace injury. However, there are exceptions, such as cases involving intentional harm, gross negligence in some states, or situations where the employer doesn't carry required workers' compensation insurance. Additionally, you may have claims against third parties (equipment manufacturers, contractors, property owners) whose negligence contributed to your injury.",
    },
    {
      question: "What benefits am I entitled to after a work injury?",
      answer:
        "Through workers' compensation, you're typically entitled to medical treatment coverage, temporary disability benefits (partial wage replacement while you recover), permanent disability benefits (if your injury causes lasting impairment), and vocational rehabilitation if you cannot return to your previous job. Through third-party claims, you may be entitled to additional compensation for pain and suffering, full lost wages and earning capacity, and other damages not covered by workers' compensation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my workers' compensation claim is denied?",
      answer:
        "If your claim is denied, you have the right to appeal the decision. Common reasons for denial include missed deadlines, disputes about whether the injury is work-related, or disagreements about the severity of the injury. Our attorneys can help you navigate the appeals process, gather additional evidence to support your claim, represent you at hearings, and explore alternative avenues for compensation such as third-party claims.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to hire a work accident attorney?",
      answer:
        "We handle work accident cases on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing unless we recover compensation for you. Initial consultations are free, and we advance all costs associated with investigating and pursuing your claim. This arrangement ensures everyone has access to quality legal representation regardless of their financial situation.",
